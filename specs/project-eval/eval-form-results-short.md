## Results
The Top 2 repos are **Pomodoro Timer (Chad Wall's repo)** and **Pomodoro Timer (James Larsen' repo)**. There was a tie between Time2Meet (Calvin Chen's repo) and Pomodoro (James Larsen' repo), and even the tie breaker of getting only the value scores was not enough. After looking over both repos as well as both evaluations and weighing the options, I decided to take the executive decision of choosing James' Pomo timer. it seems that the evaluations show there is no documentation on Time2Meet repo and after visiting it this seems to be the case. Additionally, It seems that the react technologies are used as well as firebase, both of which are only used in the Gary projects which means people who have not learned react or firebase may have more catching up to do. While it is admittedly boring to have two of the same project as the top two, I think that James' repo has more documentation that would help us get into things, additionally, the project uses rather simple dependencies (HTML,CSS,JS).
