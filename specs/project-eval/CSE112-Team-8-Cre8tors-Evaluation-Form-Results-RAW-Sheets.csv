The root of the repo is very clean. There's a clear delineation between CICD in the github workflows directory, the admin directory, the spec directory, and the source directory. So the root directory gets an A+.

Once you go a level or two down it gets much more confusing though. The delineation between what goes in admin vs what goes in spec is unclear. Why the specifications of the CICD pipeline are in the admin folder is weird.

The source folder is where it gets really hard to understand. There are multiple index.html files at different levels buried in the source. It's also hard to trace what files are inheriting from other files. Also things like audio and image dependencies are buried in editor rather than utils. CSS is scattered around between different directories. There are entire dependencies buried under several layers that are entire repos dropped in. It's hard to know where to look for stuff unless you already have gotten a sense of the repo and dug around in it.","Uses babel, editorjs, Simple Image Tool, clipboardy, parcel, puppeteer, and possibly others that I missed","There are instructions on how to launch the app from a repo and test the build pipeline.

It's also unclear how and when features were cut as well as the reasoning for how they limited the scope of the project.
