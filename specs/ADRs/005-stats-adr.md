# 005 - Stats
* Date: 05/06/22
* Status: COMPLETED

## Context and Problem Statement
* **Context:** The stats page is a little bland as it stands, as it only shows three statistics, the # of pomodoros completed, the average # of distractions per pomodoro and the success rate of pomodoros
* **Problem:** Should we renovate the stats page?

## Considered Options
* Option 1 - We should renovate the stats page
  * [+] The user may feel a better sense of accomplishment if we could provide more meaningful statistics to them. Could allow for more user retention as better statistics would provide the user with a better drive to maintain good stats.
  * [+] Gives us an inherent boost in analytics as we can collect this info.
  * [+] Distraction tracking as it exists is in of itself a distraction, which could make our app self-destructive to the goals of the pomodoro timer. Would be good to improve this statistical feature
* Option 2 - We should not renovate the stats page
  * [+] An extra feature we would need to implement
  * [+] The stats page already works and while it may be a bit rough around the edges, so long as we can polish it up and make it a bit more stylish, it still serves its purpose.
  * [+] We can still collect the statistics from what we currently have as a stats page so the utility to analytics from renovation isn't as crazy as first thought.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** We should not renovate the stats page  
This comes from the fact that the stats page is already a functional part of the website, so when considering that we have a limited amount of resources to allocate to each new implementation, it would be best to focus on something that needs more love and attention.

## Consequences
While no renovations will be made to the stats system, there is still room for minor bug fixes and polish. There are certain bugs like the failure rate that can be solved that, while not constituting a whole renovation, will improve the quality.
