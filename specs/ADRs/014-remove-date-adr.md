# 014 - Remove Date
* Date: 05/24/22
* Status: COMPLETED

## Context and Problem Statement
A minor design issue is that we felt should be mentioned. Currently the top left
displays the date, but honestly this would never be useful. On the desktop the
date is constantly shown on the bottom right so it is entirely redundant and on
mobile, often the date is shown in the toolbar in the top so it again acts as
redundant info.

## Considered Options
* Remove the Date
  * [+] Less visual clutter.
  * [+] Less redundant data being thrown at the user.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Remove the Date


## Consequences
The date should be replaced with something meaningful.
