# 009 - Edit Tasks on Timer Page
* Date: 05/11/2022
* Status: COMPLETED

## Context and Problem Statement
* **Context:**

Since we are setting the timer as the homepage, we need to be able to edit tasks from there. 

## Considered Options
* Integrate To-do list into timer page
* Leave pages separate, use modal to select task from Storage system
  * Enforce task selection
  * Don't enforce task selection

[Userflow diagrams and rough wireframes](../design-diagrams/editTasksModalAndTimerPageFlows.pdf)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** 
We will leave the pages separate and use the modal to select a task. We will try to implement it modularly so that we can decide on enforcing task selection later. 

## Consequences
A GitHub Issue has been made. This task will be a moderate one relative to others.
