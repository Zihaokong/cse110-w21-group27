## Context and Problem Statement
Website is far too dry. Looks likeit was made by an AI running on AA batteries.

## Considered Options
* Mascot to spice things up, add personality to an otherwise bleh website
  * [+] More fun
  * [-] Might be gaudy
  * [-] Might be distracting
* Refinement of what we have
  * [+] The little things are what matter
  * [-] A lot of effort
## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Both  
We will be going with boht options, though more of a focus on the mascot. This
is because the mascot, while potentially gaudy, can add a lot of personality
without much effort (see Github). We can still implement improvements to the UI,
but it would be alright if it isn't the most beautiful website on earth. As long
as it looks nice that should be good enough.

## Consequences
We need to design a mascot (or possibly hire someone) and then implement it into
the UI of the website in a non-intrusive way. We also need to improve the UI
through polishment.
