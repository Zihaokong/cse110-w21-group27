# 008 - Timer as Home Page
* Date: 05/11/2022
* Status: COMPLETED

## Context and Problem Statement
* **Context:**

Devs and users have found the timer to be initially confusing since it starts on the task list page like a todo list and doesn't immediately appear to be a pomo timer.

## Considered Options
* Leave as is (no work)
* Make timer page new homepage (requires refactoring)

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** 
We decided the timer page should be the new homepage as that makes it more clear what our product is. 

## Consequences
We will have to do more refactoring.
