# 007 - Tutorialization
* Date: 05/06/22
* Status: COMPLETED

## Context and Problem Statement
* **Context:** The pomodoro process is a very involved process that some users might not be able to pick up on their own without some guidance, which is why we are considering 
* **Problem:** Should we add tutorials to our website to help guide the user through the pomodoro process.

## Considered Options
* Option 1 - Add tutorials
  * [+] The pomodoro process might be lost on some users so it would be a straightforward way of getting people to understand how to use our website.
  * [+] More nuanced features of the website would not be lost on users since we could point them out with some tutorial, ensuring all the content is provided to the user which will clear confusions as to the layout of the website
* Option 1 - Don't add tutorials
  * [+] May be an intrusive and abrasive way of getting people accustomed to the website
  * [+] A fair amount of work needs to be done to get the tutorialization up and running since it is its own feature.
## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** Add tutorials  
The add tutorials option was chosen because we felt that while it may be a bit in your face in terms of user experience, the overhead given to the user to learn the website may pay off in the long term as they would be more dedicated to using our website since, given they stuck through all the tutorials, they would be more familiar and comfortable with our website.

## Consequences
This could possibly be another option given in the trap door options menu to enable or disable the tutorial. Additionally, we would need to keep track of what tutorials were shown so that the user won't need to sit through the same tutorials twice.
