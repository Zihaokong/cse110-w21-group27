### Task 5 - Timer As Landing Page - KAIWEN, JAMES, JAIME & FENGHAO
* The design team from last week (Kaiwen and James) have worked hard on setting up the designs for the new and improved user flow of the website. With this comes significant changes to the website which are brought up in the two main git issues as well as the

### Task 6 - Git Issue Fixing - CALVIN & CHAD
* In general there are a lot of issues on the board that need to be attended to, so in  order to get these knocked out, we will be setting up a team to fix these bugs.
* Note that while there are a fair amount of issues up on the board, but many of them are simple fixes which can be done in an hour.
* A more subjective aspect of this task is first determining which issues should be addressed! If there are some issues which are already resolved or can't be resolved in a reasonable amount of time, we need to push them off the list of issues fixed.

### Task 7 - Analytics - DZHANGIR & SOHUM
* With analytics, we will be going over three phases:
  * Planning: We will be creating a document to highlight the information we wish to collect from the user.
    * Git Issue: https://github.com/cmwall0605/cse112-sp22-group8/issues/33
  * Collection: We will be modifying the collector.js file from CSE 135 to collect the info we wish to be sending to firebase for storage.
    * Git Issue: https://github.com/cmwall0605/cse112-sp22-group8/issues/34
  * Storage: We will be using firebase to store the info collected from the collector.js file.
    * Git Issue: https://github.com/cmwall0605/cse112-sp22-group8/issues/35

### Task 8 - Timer Continuance & Settings Menu - ZHUOLIANG & LARS
* Building on the timer renovations from last sprint, there are two major points to build on from the dynamic timer system.
  * Creating a formal settings menu
    * Should edit the following:
      * volume
      * work/short-break/long-break lengths
      * enable/disable timer continuance, which is mentioned on the next section
    * Git Issue: https://github.com/cmwall0605/cse112-sp22-group8/issues/32
  * Implementing timer continuance. Time continuance is the ability for the timer to go from work session to break session seamlessly without the user needing to confirm anything. The timer should still alert the user when they are done with their session, but it should not ask for their confirmation in going to the next session.
