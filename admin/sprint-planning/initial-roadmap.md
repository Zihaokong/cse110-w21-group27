# Roadmap for things to actually do on app
## General Ideas for Final Product
* **(BIG CHANGE)** Backend leaning towards no Low
* **(BIG CHANGE)** Analytics (leaing towards Google ANalytics) Must-maybe?
* ~~**(BIG CHANGE)** Timer functionality needs to be more modular~~
  * ~~Be able to change the time of breaks and stuff- Refactor/High~~
* ~~**(BIG CHANGE)** Task list functionality~~ 
  * ~~Task list needs to look more like an actual check list. Might just be styling, might also need JS refactoring. Refactor/High~~
* Medium Tutorialization/UI Overhaul- Refactor/High
*  **(BIG CHANGE)** Possible Chrome Extension Medium
* UNKNOWN PWA No idea- need more research Jaime researches
* **(BIG CHANGE)** Codebase refactor- Doing/Must
* ~~Medium Deploy to a better host- Must~~
* ~~**(BIG CHANGE)** Testing~~
* ~~**(BIG CHANGE)** Continuous Deployment~~
* Medium Compatibility testing- Ignore IE and any extremely niche browsers. 
* Medium Keyboard controls-
* As simpel as possible- just hotkeys to major buttons, being able to tab and arrow key through items?
* Small Color blindness-    
* Small Internationalization
  * Probably not necessary as it already gets translated
    * Test in testing pipeline
* Small Mobile optimization (UI Overhaul and Refactor)
  * Medium

### Week 6
* Refactor 
* Start UI Overhaul, includes CSS Changing

* Start writing tests for better coverage (try to break the site, try to exhaust all possible states and functions) (Will go into all weeks as we touch code)
* Product will be roughly in Alpha state (all core functionality in place or roughly in place)
### Week 7 (Alpha state)
* Keyboard controls
* Will be transitioning to beta state as bugs are ironed out and functionality fleshed out



### Week 8 (Beta state)
* Continuous deployment
* Compatibility testing
* Internationalization(?)
