## 3rd Sprint Announcement
Good Evening @channel!
Today we will be going over Spring #3! I Hope you are all excited about the progress we're making and for the progress we're going to be making for this sprint. I wanted to add a new thing to these sprints and that's a theme. It's a bit late to try and implement new things to these sprints, but I suppose better late than never. The theme for this week's sprint is No Half Measures. A lot of the goals are either ideas we have been on the fence on for too long, ideas that aren't fully committed to, or systems which are not fully committed to their goals. Additionally we are re-instating the sub-team meetups, which will be posted for each team. I tried to get a time where each person on the team was available, but there were just some time constraints that couldn't be catered towards. I would really appreciate if you could make it to your respective time slot, but if you can't its understandable, but let me know so that we can perhaps meet up again as a team on Tuesday to go over it! That being said, here are the sub-teams for this week.

### :clipboard:ANALYTICS -  DZHANGIR & SOHUM - #task-07-analytics :clipboard:
* A bit of a repeat from last week but it was some what expected as Dzhangir and Sohum were focused on the README which was a more pressing issue at the time. This sprint however we need to be fully committed our analytics process. Especially since we completed HW3 in CSE 135, this process should be more intuitive to handle. The big reason we want these analytics is to live up to the standard of software engineering and to create a self-sustaining system. We want to be able to improve our website based on the behavior of the user, but in order to know what their behavior is on the website, we need analytics. First ask the question of what info we need and why, then build the tools to collect and store it.

### :tomato:BETTER UI & BRANDING - CHAD, JAMES & KAIWEN - #task-09-better-ui :tomato:
* The website as is is very sterile and dry. What we need is some personality in it! There are already some UI improvements we can make to the UI that are documented on the issues board, but we can also add some flair, some pizzazz to this project! I have considered adding a mascot and am currently in the process of getting one commissioned. I truly believe a mascot will help with users  remembering our website from competitors, but the mascot must be gracefully added in, I can think of a couple dubious websites which include a overly enthusiastic mascot.

### :bricks:WEB COMPONENTS - CHAD, LARS, ZHUOLIANG & JAIME - #task-10-web-components :bricks:
* Web components are now being added to the project! Why? Well it stems from a couple reasons. For starters, if you are going into web development as a career, this is the big thing, so this would be the perfect time to get acquainted with them! The second reason is that is creates a lot benefits to our DX. Because complex system are encapsulated into a web component, they are a lot easier on the eyes for the HTML and help with simplicity and organization. The other big benefit is that our components, if done properly, can be imported and exported into any environment, which is a major benefit to help with UI development and could even help with future goals if we ever decide to get to them.

### :wrench:TESTING - CHAD, FENGHAO & CALVIN - #task-11-testing :wrench:
* Testing is a super important feature of our project! It helps prevent bugs from ruining the user experience and should be the filter between our raw code and the perfected product we give out to the world! But as is our tests are lacking. The Cypress tests outright do not work and the unit tests are not catching as much of the functionality as we have hoped for! We need to fix that ASAP! There are some issues up on the board right now that we can take to fix these issues!
