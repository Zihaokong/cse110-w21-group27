## Assignments for the Meeting
* Get well acquainted with the project, both its repo and its end product ([link here](https://github.com/Zihaokong/cse110-w21-group27)). Look specifically at the user stories and personas in the specs and try to get a good grasp of perhaps who would want to use a pomodoro timer
* Find another pomodoro timer website which you think caters to this audience especially well. Be sure to understand why this website does the technique especially well.
* (Extra Credit) Show our base website to someone you think would be a part of the audience for a pomodoro timer (preferably someone who is unfamiliar with the technique) and get them to go through at least one session of the app. Ask their opinions on it. What did they like, what did they dislike, what would they want to see, was the design intuitive? Etc.
## Agenda
* We will first discuss, determine, and finalize the roles given out.
* Talk about your results from the assignment that was given out with the agenda.
* After getting roles out of the way, discuss the who our users are by both looking into the user stories and personas written but brainstorming ourselves who would use this product and why. Focus more specifically on why anyone would want to use this application?
* If we have time (As in we still have at least 30 minutes to have a retrospective), we should also discuss the follow:
  * Based on who we are catering towards,  discuss the values that we should strive for in our product? Do we want to be in the background or foreground of people's mind, do we want to be opinionated?
  * From these values we should construct a roadmap of all the features and improvements we want. Keep in mind always the constraints that we are dealing with (only 5 weeks to produce a 1.0 product).
* Retrospective. What went well, what could go better, what should we do moving forward?
