**Location:** Zoom
## Agenda
- Quickly dicuss the issueof the tie breaker between James' and Calvin's repos.
  - [Pomodoro Timer (James)](https://github.com/dnanjunda/cse110-w21-group11)
  - [Time2Meet (Calvin)](https://github.com/xdsherman/cse110_Time2Meet)
- Need to work on task 2 phase 2, which is creating the top 2 comparison slides
as well as choosing a repo to work on.
  - The Top two repos we need to evaluate are:
    - [Pomodoro Timer (Chad)](https://github.com/Zihaokong/cse110-w21-group27)
    - [Pomodoro Timer (James)](https://github.com/dnanjunda/cse110-w21-group11)
  - First need to fork and run both repos locally.
  - Then we need to push a minor change to see how simple it is to push a change
  through the repo
  - After doing this, we will go through the list we created on the initial repo
  evaluation slides.
    - We will be taking a deep dive into the final two repos chosen. We will 
    dissect each aspect of the project including the design, documentation, 
    programming, CI/CD, and tests used.
    - We will define what we would be doing with the project and we will draft 
    out the potential project
    timeline for each one, keeping in mind the time constraints.
      - Additionally we will drafting out the potential maintainability of this 
      project even after we reach our goals by the
    end of the quarter.
    - Set up each project and try to push significant changes to both and figure
    out how
    simple/easy/understandable it was to do this, if it even was possible.
      - Setting up the project means launching the repo and access the website 
      locally.
    - Discuss each value in strong detail. List the strengths and weaknesses of 
    each repo in relation to each
    value.
    - Run a runtime analysis and get a vital from each project. Determine if 
    these issues are brought up by the documentation or are mentioned in the 
    repo. Is it possible for us to come up with a general diagnostic of the 
    performance from reading the documentation, going over design diagrams, and 
    interpreting the code?
