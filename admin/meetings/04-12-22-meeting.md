## Working on slides for project evaluation
* Discussion of Constraints
    - Time based on CAPEs reviews
    - Skills: not everyone needs the same skill level
* Question about project slides
    - Should they be wordy or more like presentation slides?
    - Working answer: the slides are probably more for us. Can be wordy.
* Discussion of values
    - Starting from the values we discussed in class
    - Separating into values we are looking for in a repo vs./ values we think we can bring to it
    - Boiling down to a few core values
    - Defining core values
    - Discussion of how the values we can apply to projects are relevant to valuing repos
        - Landed on the idea of holding these values while we look for growth opportunities in projects
* Final slide: How to compare the top two projects
    - Looking for ways of being objective
    - Discussion of whether or not developer enthusiasm should be considered
        - Possibly something to discuss with the professor
