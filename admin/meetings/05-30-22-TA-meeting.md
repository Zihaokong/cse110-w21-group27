### Notes
**NOTE**: There was no TA meeting due to a holiday, but Priyanka posted a notice
on the slack which went as follows:

Hi Team, as it is a holiday and many people are unavailable, I plan to cancel 
this week's 1-1 meeting, but I will have my discussion hour on Wednesday as 
usual.  
Here are some updates about the task and timelines:  
* Please complete your frenemy interaction latest by tomorrow. Please let me 
  know if you have any issues. I request team leads to send me the document 
  once it is ready.
* Please make sure to work on at-least one feedback out of all the feedbacks 
  received for your project before your final 
  presentation.
* You will have to submit a one minute video or 1-2 slides ppt tomorrow just to
  let us know current status of the project.
* Please start working on your final presentations/videos and testing your work  
  end-to-end. It is very important to test your code.
  
Please feel free to reach out to me anytime if you have any queries or questions
about your project. I look forward to this week and finals week! Good luck!
