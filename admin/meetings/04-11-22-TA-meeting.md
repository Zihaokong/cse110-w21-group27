## Team Meeting Notes
First and foremost we will be redoing the past project selection in a more rigid and defined way. To assist in this endeavor, there are two tasks.
* Task 1 (Team based assignment)
  * Prepare a presentation on what we would do to evaluate a repository.
  * What are the features, constraints, and values that are crucial to consider when choosing a project.
  * Just because the code is running well does not mean it is a good project
  * Pinpoint aspects about a repo that make it a good candidate as well as what could make a repo a bad candidate. 
  * What would we do to compare the top two repos?
  * Max slides of five.
  * Due April 14th
* Task 2
  * Pass 1 (Individual based assignment)
    * Each team member will evaluate two past project repos from other team members based on the aspects, features, constraints and values brought up in task 1.
    * Spend 60 to 90 minutes on each repository, and find both the pros and the cons for it.
    * DO NOT evaluate your own repository.
    * Make sure to choose someone who is comfortable with the technology that the project uses (IE don’t give someone with no Android experience an Android based project as they won’t be able to give a strong opinion on it).
    * Assignment opens April 15th and is due April 19th.
  * Pass 2 (Team based assignment)
    * Finalize what two projects would be the best to continue going forwards based on all the evaluations created from pass 1.
    * Re-evaluate the top two and choose the best project.
    * Create a presentation talking about the two projects and talk about why one project was chosen over the other.
    * Use the aspects brought up in task 1 to specify why one is better than the other.
    * Due April 19th
* By the end, we should have a project ready to take on.
