### Notes
* Midterm week 6 thursday in person
    * The Midterm will be created by the students (team members)
    * The Professor will release a pool of question
    * We need to go through this pool and give back certain question which we 
    think are suitable for us to be tested on.
    * We will be tested on the questions given back.
        * IE we give back 30 questions, and we are given 5 questions from the 
        subset we have chosen
    * Not 100% same questions, but similar.
    * Make sure to have a team discussion
    * Not sure if 1 set for the team or based on each team member.
    * Answer Key is also created by us.
    * Every aspect of the test itself will be built by the team.
    * Not 100% sure how many questions 
* Tomorrow we will have certain presentations
    * we were selected for tomorrow's presentation
    * We will present the slides we submitted
    * We can determine how the presentation goes, but make sure that all the thoughts we want are thouroughly brought up.
    * No strict timeline, 5-8 minutes.
    * Most likely wont need to renovate the slides
* Things to be done
    * Code to be run on everyone's machine
    * Set up the repo
    * Look through the backlog to see if there's anything we can work on it
    * Planners and team leads to have a road map for the next 3 to 4 weeks.
        * What would be the outcome of each of the sprints.
    * Devops people (at least one dedicated devops person, though 2 would be better)
        * Start pipeline by this week
        * Look into the existing pipeline
    * Look through the code to figure out what code pieces need updates.
        * How much refactoring should we need.
        * Complete backlogs first before moving to new features
        * Familiarize yourself with the code base.
        * When each person goes through github, how should we allow push?
        * What are the rules we will set up in pushes and pull requests.
            * Each subgroup of tasks would have a seperate branch
        * Suggesstion: have one of the team leads be a code reviewer so that the leads keep up to date with the repo.
* Start with 1 week sprints, and if it isn't suited to our current project change it to 2 week sprints.
