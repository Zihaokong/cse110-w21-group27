### Notes
* NOTE: The original documents were not saved and lost on accident. The
following is a recollection of what occured.
* Not a formal retrospective as only a few members showed up. Instead we simply
  focused on what each sub team was respectivly doing.
  * Web components team is practically done with the timer page. All that needs
    to be fixed on is the timer buttons.
  * Analytics is going alright but might not be finished by Sunday, which means
    it may need to be backlogged for future teams.
  * Testing is going surprisingly well in terms of JEST, though cypress work
    has not begun yet.
