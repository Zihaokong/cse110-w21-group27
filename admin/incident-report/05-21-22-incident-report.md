## Design Argument on "Noob" System
### Issue
There a conflict in design beleifs between two ideas. The noob report (see 
ADR #012 for more details). Team member Chad beleived that this implementation
would benefit users because it would allow for users to ease into the pomodoro
timer process, first getting used to working on a timer and then getting used to
the task list. James believed that this would undermine the opinionated nature
of our website, allowing for users to skip the Pomodoro process as intended or
worse, not even realize that the process exists.
### Resolution
The resolution was a compromise of implementing the system, but setting up
A/B testing with the feature enabled for some and disabled for others to see
which group kept to the website for a longer period of time, because at the 
end of the day, this should only be implemented if it helps users.
