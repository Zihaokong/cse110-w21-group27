## Task list relocation
### Issue
It was unclear to us whether it was better to relocate the task list onto the timer page, given it being our new landing page.
One point of view was that it would lead to unneeded complexity for the user's to figure out, and would be a struggle to understand.
The other point of view was that it would minimize the number of clicks that a user needed to do in order to access all functionality.
### Resolution
More concrete user flow diagrams and wireframes for each proposal will be made by 05/11 and will be used to make a final decision on the matter.
