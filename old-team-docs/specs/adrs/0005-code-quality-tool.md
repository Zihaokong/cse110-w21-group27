* Date: 2021-02-06 
* Status [Superseded]

## Context and Problem Statement

* Decide which code quality tool to use for automation

## Considered Options

IDEs:
* [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) 
  * [+] Easy Setup
  * [+] Tracks quality over time
  * [+] Github intergration
  * [-] More simplistic than Code Climate  (Though could be considerd a plus)
  
* [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
  * [+] Way more in-depth than codacy
  * [+] Private
  * [+] Slack and Github intergration
  * [-] Higher learning curve
  * [-] Might complain about stylistic decisions
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: N/A


## Consequences
We cannot find the alternative free code quality tool for private GitHub project. We have decided to maintain the code quality via human review.
