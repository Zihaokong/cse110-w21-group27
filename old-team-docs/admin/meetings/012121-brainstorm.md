## Notes:
- Created feature list by going through Pomodoro slide deck

  - Main app: timer
  - Planning: task list
  - Tracking: pomo work sessions
  - Recording: storing data
  - Processing: organizing data
  - Visualizing: displaying data in dashboard
- Created user flow (bare minimum)
  - Color coded: user actions, pages
  - Pages: task list page, timer page, stats page
- Overall design should be minimal and easy to use
  - User should not need to click too many things
  - Probably start with most basic functionality first: timer and task list
