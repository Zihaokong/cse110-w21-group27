# App Theme Ideas
- Raccoons (black and white or eyes/logo on timer?)
- Tomatoes (touches on point of skeumorphic design)
- Gamification
- Minimalism
- UCSD (gold/blue)
- Plants
- School
- Sound effects to indicate timer completion - calming sounds instead of jarring?
- We could look into colorblind friendly color schemes
- Final: **Minimal, simplistic, tomatoes**
