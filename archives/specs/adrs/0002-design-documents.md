# 2. Design Documentation

* Date: 2021-01-30 
* Status [Accepted]

## Context and Problem Statement

* Decide which platform we are going to use to host our main designs of our project and its functionality.

## Considered Options

Platforms:
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) 
  * [+] Allow team collaborations and communications.
  * [+] Browser-based UI and UX design application.
  * [+] Contains design, prototyping, and code-generation tools.
  * [-] Learning curve on the tools.
  * [-] Not very user-friendly to all team members like zooming in and out of designs may not be intuitive for those who are not in the design team.
  
* [Draw.io](https://drawio-app.com/)
  * [+] Allow team collaborations and communications.
  * [+] Can be open in VSCode and integrated with Google drive.
  * [+] Good for flowchart and network diagrams.
  * [-] Using blocks may be hard to represent the whole designs.
  * [-] Formatting and adding graphic to the designs may slow down the design process.
  
* [Miro](https://miro.com/)
  * [+] Allow team collaborations and communications.
  * [+] Have functions as chat, votes, and timer for users.
  * [+] Miro's user-interfaces are intuitive like easy to add post-it notes next to the desigb and frames.
  * [+] Good for flowchart and network diagrams.
  * [+] Labels team member's contributation
  * [+] The design frame can be exported as image file for referecing or further discussion.
  * [-] Does not have code-generation tool for web app designs.
  * [-] Unable to read the comments or design offline.
  
## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Miro", because
* Tools on Miro allow us to communicate effectively and are easy to use.
* There is no learning curve on Miro; everyone can add and comments other works.
* Voting system allow us to decide which direction or design to keep; no need to create polls on other platform.


## Consequences
We will host our scratch and brainstorming ideas on Miro. We can add comments on for further explanations and vote for the version of design that we want. 
The major design and direction will be exported as image file and be added to wikis for future reference. 
Our design team will take the ideas and scratch from Miro and integrate the designs on Figma for prototype of our projects. 
The developer team can communicate with the design team on Miro for further details and getting the code for design on Figma.
