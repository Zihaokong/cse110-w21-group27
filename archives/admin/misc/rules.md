## 2. Primary means of communication
All members will post a daily stand-up on Slack before noon, and respond to any communication on Slack within a day.

## 3. Meetings
Our weekly retrospective meetings will be held on Saturday night at 8pm, and everyone is expected to attend these meetings. If one of us is unavailable, we can push the meeting to later in the night. Additional meetings will be scheduled using a poll for those involved, allowing everyone to have a say in the scheduling.

## 4. Member Responsibilities
Every member agrees to carry out the tasks associated with their roles, and to help others in the team when they need it.

## 5. Code of Conduct and Core Values
Every member agrees to abide by and respect the following rules and core values:
- Academic integrity.
- Teamwork. The primary purpose of the project is to learn how to work in a software development team, and to help each other grow.
- Enjoyment. Building something together should be fun! We shouldn’t forget to relax and enjoy ourselves from time to time.
- Respect. We’re all students here, and we’re all in the same boat. Respecting each other will allow us to have a more fulfilling experience in this course.

## 6. Conflict Resolution
If the conflict can be resolved one-to-one, then it will be talked out one-to-one. We will resolve logistical or technical conflicts through a poll, and for more difficult conflicts, we will consult with the TA.

If group members fail to carry out their responsibilities, then first the group leaders will attempt to talk with them one-on-one to see if it can be fixed. If not, we will consult with the course faculty.
