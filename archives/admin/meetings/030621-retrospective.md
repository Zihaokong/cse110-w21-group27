## Retrospective:

### LIKED: What was good?
- Unit testing and E2E testing went really well
- Refactored code looks clean and modular
- Functionality of the app came together
- With testing, its nice to have validation for when adding new things won't break the old tests
- Discussing how to handle edge cases

### LEARNED: What did the team learn?
- Edge cases are important to look at
- Different types of testing with different tools
- Considering behavior and navigation for multi-page application
- Cypress isn't as all encompassing as jest, so while its good for E2E testing, testing individual functions is better left to JEST
- Working around limitations of browsers (setInterval, playing sounds)
- Custom components can be really helpful but can also be difficult to work with

### LACKED: What did the team lack?
- Some code still needs documentations
- The team lacks  organized branches for different purposes
- Slightly less consistency for daily stand-ups
- Organizing discussion presentations
- Keeping more up to date on issues and closing them when finished
- Need more meta documentation (ADRs, formal development documentation)

### LONGED FOR: What did the team long for?
- More descriptions on the testing coverage and structure of the apps like components
- More guidance on edge cases that will be tested
